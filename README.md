This repository is meant to provide some examples for you to better understand
the features of the OpenTok Linux SDK.

The sample applications here can be used either in regular desktop environments
or in any tiny single-board computer such as the Raspberry Pi.

The sample applications are meant to be used with the latest version of the
OpenTok Linux SDK. Feel free to copy and modify the source code herein for your
own projects.

Please consider sharing your modifications with us, especially if they might
benefit other developers using the OpenTok Linux SDK. See the License for more

## What's inside

### [Publisher Only](Publisher-Only)

This sample application shows how to publish a video and audio stream to a
session. This sample application might cover a suitable use case where we just
want to publish a video and audio stream from a party. Examples are a video
surveillance equipment, a smart bell, etc.

### [Basic Video Chat](Basic-Video-Chat)

This sample application shows you how to connect to an OpenTok session, publish
a stream, and subscribe to a stream.

### [Basic Video Chat With Server](Basic-Video-Chat-With-Server)

This sample application shows you how to connect to an OpenTok session, publish
a stream, and subscribe to a stream. The new thing here is that you are using
a server to create sessions, generate tokens for those sessions, archive
(or record) sessions, and download those archives.
