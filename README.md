This repository provides examples of applications that use the  OpenTok Linux SDK.

The sample applications here can be used either in regular desktop environments
or in any tiny single-board computer, such as the Raspberry Pi.

The sample applications are meant to be used with the latest version of the
OpenTok Linux SDK. Feel free to copy and modify the source code for your
own projects.

Please consider sharing your modifications with us, especially if they might
benefit other developers using the OpenTok Linux SDK. See the License for more
information.

## What's inside

This repo includes the following sample applications.

### [Publisher Only](Publisher-Only)

This sample application shows how to publish a audio-video stream to an OpenTok
session. This sample application might cover a use case in which an application
publishes an audio-video stream from a device. Examples are a video
surveillance equipment application, a smart bell, etc.

### [Basic Video Chat](Basic-Video-Chat)

This sample application shows you how to connect to an OpenTok session, publish
a stream, and subscribe to a stream.

### [Basic Video Chat With Server](Basic-Video-Chat-With-Server)

This sample application shows you how to connect to an OpenTok session, publish
a stream, and subscribe to a stream. However, this application retrieves the
OpenTok session ID and token from a web service, as you would would in a
real-world application.
